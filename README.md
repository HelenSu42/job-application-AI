## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Encore CLI

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-application-assistant.git
   cd job-application-assistant
   ```

2. **Install Encore CLI** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   curl -L https://encore.dev/install.sh | bash
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   The application requires an OpenRouter API key for AI functionality:
   - Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and create an account
   - Generate an API key
   - In the Leap UI, go to the Infrastructure tab and set the `OpenRouterKey` secret

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   encore run
   ```

   This will start both the backend and frontend development servers.

6. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:4000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:4000/api
   - Encore Dashboard: http://localhost:9400

- **Data Privacy**: User data is never shared with third parties
- **File Processing**: Resume parsing happens securely without permanent storage
- **API Security**: All endpoints include proper validation and error handling

## Deployment

The application is built with Encore.ts, which provides built-in deployment capabilities:

1. **Production Build**
   ```bash
   encore build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Encore Cloud**
   ```bash
   encore deploy
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set production secrets in the Encore dashboard
   - Configure OpenRouter API key for production
   - Set up production database

## Testing

### Backend Unit Tests (Vitest)
- Use Vitest for unit-testing core logic without running the Encore runtime.
- Tests live alongside source files as `*.test.ts` under `backend/`.
- Run tests locally:

```bash
cd backend && bun install && bun run test
```

- CI/CD and staging reuse the same unit tests/commands. Runtime or integration tests (hitting real Encore APIs) can be added separately with `encore test` if desired.

#### Pepper handling in tests
- The code reads `PasswordPepper` via `encore.dev/config.secret` and falls back to an empty string when absent.
- Tests mock `encore.dev/config` to simulate both cases (pepper present vs absent).
